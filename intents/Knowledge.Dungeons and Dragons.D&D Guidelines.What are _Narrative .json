            "Durations in 5e serve a narrative purpose. \"1 minute\" is shorthand for \"about the length of one combat\". \"10 minutes\" is shorthand for \"a short period of time not in combat\". You would never have a duration of \"4 rounds\" or \"10 rounds\". Most combat encounters last 4 to 6 rounds: use 1 minute. Similarly, you wouldn\u0027t have a feature that reduces ritual casting from 10 minutes to 1 minute. There isn\u0027t much narrative difference between a 1 minute casting time and a 10 minute casting time: neither can happen in combat, and they are both less than the next step, 1 hour. And again, durations such as 30 minutes, 4 hours should not be used. Use 1 hour (a bit of a day) or 8 hours (most of the day). I shouldn\u0027t have to point this out, but I\u0027ve seen editors do this, there should be no durations measured in seconds."
