            "You can buy dice almost anywhere that sells DnD books (except book stores, generally). If you are purchasing a starter set, it will include dice. You can also get dice from companies like these: Game Science - High precision dice, but fairly expensive Chessex - Produces many of the dice you see in stores, and sells a pound of dice. Keep in mind that the pound of dice sometimes contains \"factory seconds\" (dice which aren\u0027t quite the right shape) Easy Roller Dice Co. - Similar to Chessex, and offers a comparably priced bulk dice order which gurantees full sets of factory first dice (no messed up dice)"
