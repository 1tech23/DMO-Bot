            "Guns do not appear in the standard equipment section of the Playerâ€™s Handbook. If you would like to have one, you will have to talk with your Dungeon Master. Most DMs disallow firearms for their own reasons. Some examples include: early guns were rather less reliable than a bow and the DM wants to avoid the anachronism of semiautomatic weapons in a late medieval setting; because gunpowder fundamentally changed society and the DM wants to maintain a medieval feel; and/or because the raw materials for gunpowder are simply not available. Ultimately, the decision about whether to include or exclude guns from a campaign rests with the DM. Your DM might also place certain restrictions on guns if they are to be included, such as requiring that your character have a certain backstory to be proficient with them."
